    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model is the nvidia neural network model mentioned in class and consists of 5 convolution layers followed by 3 dense layers\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# nvidia model\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(24, 5, 5, subsample=(2,2), activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(36, 5, 5, subsample=(2,2), activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(48, 5, 5, subsample=(2,2), activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(Flatten())\n",
    "model.add(Dense(100))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(50))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(10))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(Lambda(lambda x: (x / 255.0) - 0.5, input_shape=XtrainInputShape))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being replaced by the nvidia model, the LeNet model was used and it contained dropout layers\n",
    "in order to reduce overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# add lenet\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(10, 5, 5, input_shape=XtrainInputShape, activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(MaxPooling2D())\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(6, 5, 5, activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(MaxPooling2D())\n",
    "model.add(Flatten())\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(.25))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(120))\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(.25))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(84))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the *validation_split* parameter, the model was trained on 80% of the data and validated on 20% of the data to reduce overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "adamOptimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.0001)\n",
    "model.compile(optimizer=adamOptimizer, loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy'])\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_split=0.2, shuffle=True, nb_epoch=4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The model was very sensitive to overfitting and reducing the number of epochs seemed to be the primary way\n",
    "to stop the training when the model started overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer. In the final training pass, the learning rate was reduced to 0.0001 using the lr (LR) parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road,\n",
    "but I did not have enough memory to flip the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to follow the class lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a LeNet convolution neural network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train.shape: (32511, 160, 320, 3) y_train.shape: (32511,)\n",
    "X_train[0].shape: (160, 320, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(10, 5, 5, input_shape=XtrainInputShape, activation=\"relu\"))\n",
    "model.add(MaxPooling2D())\n",
